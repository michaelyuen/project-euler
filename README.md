# Project Euler

My Project Euler Solutions

Currently just plain JavaScript with a simple node wrapper for ease of use.

In the future, I would like to expand this to other languages as well. I think it would be a great learning aid.

## To Run a Solution

```
node app --[SOLUTION_NUMBER]

node app --009 // solution 9
```
